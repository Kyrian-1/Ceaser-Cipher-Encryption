 *Overview

This is a simple Python program that implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encrypting and decrypting text. The tool allows users to shift letters by a specified value, preserving case and non-alphabetic characters.

 *Features





Encrypt text using a user-defined shift value (1-25).



Decrypt text back to its original form with the same shift value.



Handles uppercase, lowercase, and special characters.



Includes basic input validation and error handling.

 *How to Use





Run the script (python caesar_cipher.py).



Choose an option: 1 for encrypt, 2 for decrypt, or 3 to exit.



Enter the message and shift value when prompted.



View the resulting encrypted or decrypted text.

Requirements





Python 3.x
